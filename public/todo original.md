## Reminders:
- You will be working with data at [http://localhost:3000/department](http://localhost:3000/department) which mimics a simple backend API providing JSON data. You can request a single record from that API using http://localhost:3000/department/{id}
- Some items on the to-do list are intentionally vague, leaving you to decide what is best. Design what you like and make a note of any assumptions.
- There isn't a lot of time so don't worry about how it looks.
- Tackle the list in any order you like.
- Commit frequently (at least once per task) with descriptive messages.

## To-do:
1. The user should be able to toggle the display of these instructions.
2. The page should list the members of the department from the dataset (their name and job title).
3. The user should be able to click to open their full profile.
4. The user should be able to filter the list by "team".
5. The user should be able to search the list.
7. There is no API yet to allow adding new users. Write a message for the backend developer describing what you need (for example in a new text or markdown file). You do not need to create the UI.
